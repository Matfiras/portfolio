          <p>The importance of management is something that I have understood since 
            my very early professional  career. In fact, I believe that  an engineer that 
            lacks effective communication and interpersonal skills is being on the wrong track. 
            And I started to consider that business and engineering are strongly related as we can’t 
            promote our product (even if it is perfectly done) and ‘sell’ it if we lack the ability 
            to express, negotiate and effectively communicate. That's why, I applied for a scholarship 
            named <a href="http://www.eniso.rnu.tn/fr/" target="_blank">ITEC</a> and I was able to join the <a href="http://www.eniso.rnu.tn/fr/" target="_blank">International Management Institute</a> in India. 
            And, I was selected as the best participant in my promotion and won an International 
            certificat in strategic Management for emerging markets.</p>

           <p>After the high school, I was not sure about what career path to follow. But, I can still remember when I was a child, I always 
             get excited just thinking about breaking something down. Mechatronics engineering was about barely the same thing. So I chose the <a href="http://www.eniso.rnu.tn/fr/">National School of Engineers of Sousse</a>, I studied mechanical 
             courses as well as electronic courses, and I get the oppoertunity to 
             experience new technologies such as 3D printing.

                I’ve built my career in a variety of roles and fields, where I was not only
                technology whiz, but also actively involved in the business development and proved an excellent ability
                to build rapport with internal and external stakeholders from all backgrounds.
               </br>
                Actually, since I was a student, I have actively
                worked in the civil society and I participated in NGOs and National Events. For instance, I gained Good
                communication, networking and negotiation skills as well as good organizational skills through my
                experience as the Co-Founder and president of an NGO named AUXILIUM Tunisia.
                I also won the Second price in <a href="http://www.atbchallenge.com/">ATB Challenge: Management technology and entrepreneurial initiative</a>
                which is a competition for young Tunisians carrying innovative and original projects in the following
                areas: Art and Culture, Science and Technology, Management technology and entrepreneurial initiative.
                Hence, I believe that my academic background has successfully provided me with a solid foundation in
                many fields such as, business administration, economics and entrepreneurship.
              </br>
                Since 2015, I began as a technical manager in a start’up in Sousse, Tunisia. This experience gave me the
                opportunity to enhance my skills in CAD as well as 3D printing technologies and prototyping.
              </br>
                Moreover, I have been always very interested in making an international experiences, that's why I applied in many jobs abroad. So, I was accepted for an 
                internship in Indonesia with <a href="https://www.ibcsd.or.id/">the Indonesia Business Council for Sustainable Development</a> in 2016. The organization aims to enable its member companies to 
                have a global vision and become more competitive.
                Then, in December 2017, I worked as a project assistant with an organization named <a href="https://www.ema-germany.org/de/willkommen/">Euro-Mediterranean Association
                for Cooperation and Development EMA e.V</a> based in Hamburg, Germany. It aims to a far- reaching
                cooperation between Germany and the MENA region.

            In October 2018, I with my team won the second prize of the Arab development HACKATHON named <a href="http://www.arabdevelopmentportal.com/viz2030">Visualize 2030 </a>which took place in Beirut.
          </br>
          </br>“Visualize 2030” is an initiative of the Arab Development Portal which aims to encourage 
          the consumption of data by youth from the Arab region in support of advocacy campaigns and innovative 
          thinking around development priorities and to advance their contribution to informed public debate 
          in the region. The data camp brings together youth from Arab countries to enhance their technical and analytical capacity to produce visual 
          content on the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the SDGs.
          </br>Our project was about discussing the necessity of updating the social contract in the the 
          Arabian countries. The output that we made was a data-driven visual product using the ADP Database 
          or other official national sources.

              Actually, I am very passionate about the different cultures of the world and have been 
              that way since I was a child. I get a rush just thinking about meeting new people from 
              different countries. After the Tunisian revolution in 2011, the country was suffering 
              from an economic recession due to the political turmoil. Some extremist groups had taken 
              advantage of that instability and started indoctrinating youth, who’s who are suffering 
              from joblessness, illiteracy and poverty. My country’s youth were so manipulated that they 
              did not hesitate to suicide or make terrorism attacks. The plight of my fellows was tragic 
              and depressing. Terror, hate and intolerance had been advocated by those extremists. 
              At first, I was terrified. I felt like a stranger in my own country.  However, I had a 
              belief that if we accepted fear and surrender to division and hate, we would lose ourselves 
              and the country too. We needed to unite our efforts. Then, I decided in February 2014 to 
              accomplish a Tunisian road trip by bike, in which I crossed 2100 km and visited almost all 
              the Tunisian cities from north to south. During this trip, I met a diverse range of people 
              from all walks of life. I discovered that despite our difference, we had human and moral 
              values in common. That trip was definitely a turning point; it had remarkably expanded my 
              perspective of home and endowed me with a greater sense of brotherhood. For instance, 
              I realized how much safer and stronger we can be, if we connected with one another. 
              Leaving my comfort zone, was a trigger of a new life style and way of thinking. It 
              enhanced in me the ability of acceptance and I become more flexible, creative and proactive. 
              Since then, I work to make the world more connected and sustainable.  Since then, I work to 
              make people more aware about how wider the world actually is. Because since that day, I have 
              become a world citizen.
